# VinesDontGrow for Minecraft with fabric
Makes vines not grow so you can use them in any build without fearing the apocalypse.

No but seriously, vines can spread on walls, up to a lava source, and then fire back up to your HOUSE ! So install this mod now.

To build :
gradlew build

Get the file in /build/libs/
